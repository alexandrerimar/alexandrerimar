As a psychologist pursuing a Master's Degree in Neuroscience & Behavior, I am investigating the link between **_gamers' decision-making_** and symptoms of gaming disorder. I developed my reseach using Python for data analysis and Unity3D for data collection.

I am passionate about merging my knowledge in psychology, particularly in areas like **behavioral economics** and **decision-making**, with **data science**. My goal is to leverage this interdisciplinary approach to produce useful insights that can inform and enhance decision-making and problem-solving in both academic and industry settings. 

Additionally, my love for technology and dedicated research into gamers' behavior have fueled my enthusiasm to explore how data science can be applied to understand user behavior and improve gaming experiences, opening up exciting possibilities at the intersection of psychology, data science, and technology.


## Projects
* [**Impulsive Behavior Assessment Tool**](https://github.com/alexandrerimar/mrcoxinha-game)
  <p>Impulsivity is strongly correlated with impulse control disorders. This inovative tool aims to assess gamers impulsive behavior using a simple first-person shooter game. It has been developed using Unity3D, as part of my Master's Reseach Project. The game has been named "Mr. Coxinha" due to the striking resemblance of its enemies to a typical and delicious Brazilian dish. For a more technical explanation on how the game works, please refer to the readme file in the game repository.</p> 
* [**Delay Discounting Task Web app**](https://github.com/alexandrerimar/dlc)
  <p> This web app was develop using JavaScript and PHP, to assess gamers impulsive behavior using a psychology task known as Delay Discounting. It was created as part of my Scientific Initiation Project. </p>
